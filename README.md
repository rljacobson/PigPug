The paper _Building-in Equational Theories_ by G. D. Plotkin describes the Pig-Pug algorithm for pattern matching in equational theories. This classic paper deserves a wider modern audience, but it appears to only be avalable in an inconvenient format. This repo provides the paper in three different formats:

 1. [PigPug.pdf](PigPug.pdf), PDF format
 2. [PigPug.tex](PigPug.tex), LaTeX source of the above
 3. [PigPug.md](PigPug.md), Markdown
 4. [Plotkin1972.pdf](Plotkin1972.pdf), a cleaned-up scan of the published paper ([original source](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/building_in_equational_theories.pdf))
